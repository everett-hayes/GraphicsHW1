1.) Simple Shapes <br>
A donut geometry is featured around the heart.

2.) Parametric Shapes <br>
A heart geometry is placed in the middle.

3.) Patterns <br>
All the geometries feature checker patterns some with different colors and sizes.

4.) Animated Patterns <br>
All the geometries feature a "hypno" effect on the checkerbaord

5.) Animated Shapes <br>
The smooth pinch of the geometries is featured in the vertex shaders. The rotations are not from the vertex shaders.

6.) Events <br>
The heart and donut will move with "wasd" and will wrap around the page.
