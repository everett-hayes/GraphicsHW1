# Homework #1 Graphics

1.) Simple Shapes
A donut geometry is featured around the heart.

2.) Parametric Shapes
A heart geometry is placed in the middle.

3.) Patterns
All the geometries feature checker patterns some with different colors and sizes.

4.) Animated Patterns
All the geometries feature a "hypno" effect on the checkerbaord

5.) Animated Shapes
The smooth pinch of the geometries is featured in the vertex shaders. The rotations are not from the vertex shaders.

6.) Events
The heart and donut will move with "wasd" and will wrap around the page.
